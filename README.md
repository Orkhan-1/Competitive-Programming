# Competitive Programming

## Purpose

Welcome to the Competitive Programming! This repository contains comprehensive solutions to various coding problems,
including but not limited to LeetCode challenges, algorithm implementations, and more. Whether you're a novice or an
experienced programmer, you'll find meticulously crafted solutions and valuable insights to enhance your problem-solving
skills and knowledge.

## Video Format

Each solution follows a structured format:

1. **Problem Statement**: A brief overview of the problem statement.
2. **Approach**: Explanation of the chosen approach to tackle the problem.
3. **Code Walkthrough**: Step-by-step breakdown of the code implementation.
4. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**: In-depth analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.

## Supported Languages

Default language for all solutions is Java. I'm adding more language support. Currently, I extended it to followings:

- Python
- Java
- JS
- Go
- C++
- Scala

## Repository Organization

The repository houses the source code for all LeetCode solutions discussed in the videos. Solutions are categorized by
problem title for easy navigation and reference.
